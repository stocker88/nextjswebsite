&nbsp;

And even more ETFs and Cryptos (let's not get you overwhelmed).

&nbsp;

With a Newsletter, by the end of the year, you followed 12 stocks.

&nbsp;

With HelloStocker AI, by the end of the year, you beat the SP500 market.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The Guru makes money with trading?

&nbsp;

**Not with his trading, with yours.**

&nbsp;


\- 1) The Guru shows you expensive cars rented in Dubai

&nbsp;

\- 2) The Guru pushes you to trade

&nbsp;

\- 3) You open an account with his affiliate broker

&nbsp;

\- 4) üßêThe affiliate pays the Guru $600

&nbsp;

\- 5) ü§ØThe Guru pushes you to day trade and takes 50% commissions on your trades

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### The Guru takes half your commissions!

Unless you live in Puerto Rico, your commissions and taxes will eat all your gains.

&nbsp;

Long term investing is taxed 20%.

&nbsp;

Dividends are taxed 0%.
