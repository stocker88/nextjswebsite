## 1) Email Newsletters are outdated

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### Newsletters send you 1 email per month, your AI sends you 60 recommendations per month (2 per day)

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

There are 500 stocks in the SP500

&nbsp;

3000 stocks in the Russell 3000

&nbsp;

2500 tech stocks in the Nasdaq.

&nbsp;

And even more ETFs and Cryptos (let's not get you overwhelmed).

&nbsp;

With a Newsletter, by the end of the year, you followed 12 stocks.

&nbsp;

You cannot possibly enjoy benefits from Diversification.

&nbsp;

And most likely you won't be learning much.

&nbsp;


With StocksToBuyNow AI, by the end of the year:

&nbsp;

&nbsp; - you diversified your portfolio with stocks that beat the SP500 market,

&nbsp;

&nbsp; - you get better at investing and understand the subtilities of macro economics, technical trading, and financial reportings.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### Newsletter are slow to respond, your AI is available 24/7

&nbsp;

Have you tried emailing a newsletter?

&nbsp;

They respond within 30 days (if they don't forget about you).

&nbsp;

Do you know by how much can a stock price move within a month?

&nbsp;

Enough for you to review the price again and send them another email.

&nbsp;

StocksToBuyNow is available 24/7 and replies instantly.


&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## 2) You shouldn't trust Whatsapp Gurus

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The Guru makes money with trading?

&nbsp;

**Not with his trading, with yours.**

&nbsp;


\- 1) The Guru shows you expensive cars rented in Dubai

&nbsp;

\- 2) The Guru pushes you to trade

&nbsp;

\- 3) You open an account with his affiliate broker

&nbsp;

\- 4) üßêThe affiliate pays the Guru $600

&nbsp;

\- 5) ü§ØThe Guru pushes you to day trade and takes 50% commissions on your trades

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### The Guru takes half your commissions!

Unless you live in Puerto Rico, your commissions and taxes will eat all your gains.

&nbsp;

Short term trading is taxes 40%.

&nbsp;

Long term investing is taxed 20%.

&nbsp;

Dividends are taxed 0%.

&nbsp;
