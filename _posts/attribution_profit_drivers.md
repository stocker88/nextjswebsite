The S&P500 stock market is a big financial playground made up of different sectors, like technology and healthcare.

Imagine it as a team of 500 players, each player being a stock from various companies.

All these players work together, and their price performance affects how well the entire team, or stock market, is doing.

So, when we talk about the S&P500 market, we're looking at how all these stocks are doing together.

It is well known that over the long run, only very few investors manage to outperform the S&P500 (Warren Buffet is one of them).

We will teach you how to beat the S&P500 stock market: you will know what stocks to buy and focus your trading analysis on.

You can become the next Warren Buffett thanks to the mathematics of investing: performance Attribution !

## **Performance Attribution**


HelloStocker Price performance Attribution allows you to understand what are your skills: what you are good at and what are the stocks you should invest in.

Attribution explains your performance over the S&P500 or any other market benchmark, and gives you the best stocks and market segmentations for you to maximize your profits.

The better you are at making money with certains stocks, the more money and passive income you will generate by focusing on the same type of stocks.

### **1) Selection Skill**

You could be doing great at buying technology stocks that outperform the S&P Technology sector, and doing not so well at buying health stocks that outperform the S&P Health market sector.

Are you great at selecting the stocks that will outperform its respective sector segment? Are other investors better than you at picking Healthcare stocks? What are the best stocks to buy?

### **2) Allocation Skill**

You could be doing great at forecasting what would happen to Technology stocks:
- increasing your positions (buying more tech stocks) when you expect the sector to be doing well, 
- and decreasing them (selling them) when you expect it to perform poorly.

Are you great at allocating your investments across industries? 

Are you great at timing which stock market sector will go up and when you should buy vs sell?

If not, do you have friends or an investor network where some individuals are better at understanding economic cycles better? 

Maybe they should be the ones allocating weights for you instead?

Some people are good at timing which sector to buy and when, some people are good at picking which stocks to buy and when.

### **3) Interaction Skill**

For example, if:
1) you had superior selection skills (you are great at picking stocks in a specific market sector) 
2) and overweighted that particular sector (you knew it would go up)
-> the interaction effect would be positive!

However, if:
1) you had superior selection, 
2) but underweighted that stock market sector (you thought this it would go down) 
-> the interaction effect would be negative.

In this case, you did not take advantage of the superior selection by allocating more assets to that sector.

To reach financial freedom, and make money with investing, you must understand performance attribution.

Understand how good you are at picking stocks in each market sector.

And analyze with HelloStocker how good you are at forecasting which stock market sector will be going up.

Do you know your strengths? Do you know how to make money with stocks?

## **The Math behind**

In HelloStocker App, your AI Financial Advisor can segment your portfolio with respect to many metrics.

Recommendations are made by stock fundamentals such as value, growth, and other financial metrics and ratios.

You can also sort stocks by Popularity and Social metrics.

Attribution is such a powerful tool: it tells you what stocks to buy and when!

Again, for simplicity, let's assume the segmentation is done by market sector.

We list below the calculation methodologies, a positive figure means you are skilled.

The higher the number the more skilled you are.

Understanding the math behind will help you develop a sense of how the SP500 stock market works and further improve your trading skills.


### **1) Selection Skill**


The selection effect measures the investor's ability to select / pick the best stocks within a given sector.

We see whether you beat the market by comparing your picks to the SP500 market picks for the same sector. 

A positive selection effect occurs for a particular market sector when your stock portfolio return is greater than the SP500 market return.


The Selection Effect for the Technology stocks is calculated using the below metrics and formula:


* \-  Technology stocks weight in the S&P500
* \-  Technology stocks return of the S&P500
* \-  Technology stocks return of our Portfolio

### **2) Allocation Skill**


The allocation effect measures the investor's ability to effectively allocate their portfolio's assets to winning sectors.

Positive allocation occurs when you overweighted (buy more of) a sector that performs better than the S&P500.

It also happens when you underweighted (buy less of) a sector that doesn't perform as well as the S&P500.

The Allocation Effect for the Technology stock is calculated using the below formula:

* \-  Technology stocks weight in our Portfolio
* \-  Technology stocks weight in the S&P500
* \-  Technology stocks return of the S&P500
* \-  Total price return of the S&P500

### **3) Interaction Skill**


If you are good at selecting stocks for a particular sector, you should overallocate the weight of this market sector in your portfolio.

You should buy more of what you are good at.

A positive interaction effect on the technology stocks sector would occur for instance when both of the following conditions are met:

* \-  your investor's portfolio weight in technology stocks was greater than the S&P500 weight in the same market sector,
* \-  your investor's portfolio return for technology stocks was greater than the S&P500 return for the same market sector.

In this scenario, you as an investor investor exercised good selection by buying more stocks in this market sector.

The interaction effect would also be positive if you underweighted the industries for which you underperformed because of poor selection skills.

You knew you would not be so good at making money on this sector so you didn't buy as much of it.

The Interaction Effect for the Technology stocks is calculated using the below formula:


* \-  Technology stocks weight in our portfolio
* \-  Technology stocks return of our portfolio
* \-  Technology stocks weight in the S&P500 market
* \-  Technology stocks return of the S&P500 market

## **Know your strengths: buy stocks you are best at choosing and make more money than the market**

The sum of all these effects is equal to the difference between your portfolio performance and the stock market performance.

All these effects sum to your Excess Return over the market, often referred as 'Active Return'.

Your active return explain how well you are doing over the market and why:

* \-  How good you are at selecting stocks in each sectors
* \-  How good you are at allocating your positions across sectors
* \-  How good you know your strengths and buy more or less of each sectors based on how well you select stocks within that sector.

When you know where your performance comes from, you can build an efficient strategy.

An investment strategy that will help you consistently beat the SP500 market.
