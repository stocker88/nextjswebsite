We will explain the methodology used at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.

&nbsp;

But first let's remember what is the SP500.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The S&P500 stock market is a big financial playground.

&nbsp;

It is made up of different sectors, like technology and healthcare.

&nbsp;

Imagine it as a team of 500 players.


&nbsp;

Each player being a stock from various companies.

&nbsp;

All these players work together.

&nbsp;

And their price performance affects how well the entire team, or stock market, is doing.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

So, when we talk about the S&P500 market, we're looking at how all these stocks are doing together.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

It is well known that over the long run, only very few investors manage to outperform the S&P500.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

We will teach you how to beat the S&P500 stock market.


&nbsp;


You will know what stocks to buy and focus your trading on.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

You could become the next Warren Buffett by understanding what drives your performance and how to make better investment decisions.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## Performance Attribution

&nbsp;


&nbsp;

Our in-app performance attribution allows you to understand what are your skills.


&nbsp;

What you are good at.

&nbsp;

And what are the stocks you should invest in.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Attribution explains your performance over the S&P500 or any other market benchmark.

&nbsp;

It tells you what are the best stocks and market segmentations for you to focus on in order to maximize your profits.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The better you are at making money with certains stocks, the more money and passive income you will generate with them.


&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Focus your time and energy on what you are good at.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### **1) Selection Skill**


&nbsp;

![](/assets/blog/attribution/selection.webp)

&nbsp;

Are you great at buying technology stocks that outperform the sp500 technology sector?

&nbsp;

If so, you have superior tech selection skills!

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Are you good at selecting healthcare stocks that outperform the sp500 healthcare sector?


&nbsp;

If so, you have superior healthcare selection skills.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

And so on.

&nbsp;

Selection skills tell you how good you are at selecting the stocks that will outperform its respective sector segment.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### **2) Allocation Skill**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

![](/assets/blog/attribution/allocation.webp)

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

You could be doing great at forecasting what would happen to Technology stocks:

&nbsp;

\- increasing your positions (buying more tech stocks) when you expect the sector to be doing well,

&nbsp;

\- and decreasing them (selling them) when you expect it to perform poorly.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Are you great at allocating your investments across sectors? 

&nbsp;

Are you great at timing which stock market sector will go up?

&nbsp;

Are you good at timing when you should buy vs sell?


&nbsp;

&nbsp;

If so, you have superior allocation skills.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Some of you are good at timing which overall sector to buy and when.

&nbsp;

Others are good at picking which stocks to buy within a particular sector.

&nbsp;

Use StocksToBuyNow app to receive insights on allocation timing!


&nbsp;

&nbsp;


### **3) Interaction Skill**


&nbsp;

&nbsp;

![](/assets/blog/attribution/performance_attribution.jpg)

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

For example, if:

&nbsp;

1. **1)** you had superior selection skills (you are great at picking stocks in a specific market sector)

&nbsp;

2. **2)** and overweighted that particular sector (you knew it would go up)

&nbsp;

-> the interaction effect would be positive!

&nbsp;
&nbsp;


However, if:

&nbsp;

1. **1)** you had superior selection,

&nbsp;

2. **2)** but underweighted that stock market sector (you thought this it would go down)

&nbsp;

-> the interaction effect would be negative.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

In this case, you did not take advantage of the superior selection by allocating more assets to that sector.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


### **1) Selection Skill**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

![](/assets/blog/attribution/selection.webp)

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The selection effect measures the investor's ability to select / pick the best stocks within a given sector.

&nbsp;

We see whether you beat the market by comparing your picks to the SP500 market picks for the same sector. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

A positive selection effect occurs for a particular market sector when your stock portfolio return is greater than the SP500 market return.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


The Selection Effect for the Technology stocks is calculated using the below metrics and formula:

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

![](/assets/blog/attribution/attributionselectionskills.png)

&nbsp;

* \-  Technology stocks weight in the S&P500

* \-  Technology stocks return of the S&P500

* \-  Technology stocks return of our Portfolio

&nbsp;


&nbsp;

### **2) Allocation Skill**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

![](/assets/blog/attribution/allocation.webp)

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The allocation effect measures the investor's ability to effectively allocate their portfolio's assets to winning sectors.

&nbsp;

Positive allocation occurs when you overweighted (buy more of) a sector that performs better than the S&P500.

&nbsp;

It also happens when you underweighted (buy less of) a sector that doesn't perform as well as the S&P500.

&nbsp;

The Allocation Effect for the Technology stock is calculated using the below formula:

&nbsp;

![](/assets/blog/attribution/attributionallocationskill.png)

&nbsp;

* \-  Technology stocks weight in our Portfolio

* \-  Technology stocks weight in the S&P500

* \-  Technology stocks return of the S&P500

* \-  Total price return of the S&P500

&nbsp;


&nbsp;


### **3) Interaction Skill**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

![](/assets/blog/attribution/performance_attribution.jpg)

&nbsp;


If you are good at selecting stocks for a particular sector, you should overallocate the weight of this market sector in your portfolio.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### You should buy more of what you are good at.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

A positive interaction effect on the technology stocks sector would occur for instance when both of the following conditions are met:

&nbsp;

* \- 1)  your investor's portfolio weight in technology stocks was greater than the S&P500 weight in the same market sector,

* \- 2)  your investor's portfolio return for technology stocks was greater than the S&P500 return for the same market sector.

&nbsp;

In this scenario, you as an investor investor exercised good selection by buying more stocks in this market sector.

&nbsp;

The interaction effect would also be positive if you underweighted the industries for which you underperformed because of poor selection skills.

&nbsp;

You knew you would not be so good at making money on this sector so you didn't buy as much of it.

&nbsp;

The Interaction Effect for the Technology stocks is calculated using the below formula:

&nbsp;

![](/assets/blog/attribution/attributioninteractionskills.png)

&nbsp;

* \-  Technology stocks weight in our portfolio

* \-  Technology stocks return of our portfolio

* \-  Technology stocks weight in the S&P500 market

* \-  Technology stocks return of the S&P500 market



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## Know your strengths: save time and make more money

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The sum of all these effects is equal to the difference between your portfolio performance and the stock market performance.

&nbsp;

All these effects sum to your Excess Return over the market, often referred as 'Active Return'.

&nbsp;

Your active return explain how well you are doing over the market and why:

&nbsp;

* \- 1)  How good you are at selecting stocks in each sectors
 
* \- 2)  How good you are at allocating your positions across sectors

* \- 3)  How good you know your strengths and buy more or less of each sectors based on how well you select stocks within that sector.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

An investment strategy that will help you consistently beat the SP500 market.
