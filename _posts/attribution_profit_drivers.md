The market is like a big financial playground made up of different industries, like technology and healthcare. 

Imagine it as a team of 500 players, each player being a stock from various companies. 

All these players work together, and their performance affects how well the entire team, or market, is doing. 

So, when we talk about the market, we're looking at how all these stocks are doing together.

It is well known that over the long run, only very few investors manage to outperform the market.

However by understanding what stocks are driving your gains and losses (who are your good and bad players / friends), you can become the next Warren Buffett, fine tune your investing strategy, and learn how to beat the market!

## **Performance Attribution**



Stocker Performance Attribution allows you to understand what are your skills: what you are good at and what are the stocks you should invest in.

This will explain your performance and give you the best stocks and category of stocks for you to maximize your profits. The better you are at making money with a certain company, the more money and passive income you will generate by focusing on this company. 

### **1) Selection Skill**

You could be doing great at picking technology stocks that outperform the S&P technology industry, and doing not so well at picking health stocks that outperform the S&P health industry.

Are you great at selecting the stocks that will outperform its respective industry industry segment? Are other investors better than you at picking Healthcare stocks? Who is the best suited to advise you?

### **2) Allocation Skill**

You could be doing great at forecasting what would happen to the technology industry, increasing your positions when you expect the sector to be doing well, and decreasing them when you expect it to underperform.

Are you great at allocating your investments across industries? Are you great at timing which industry will go up and when?

If not, do you have friends or an investor network where some individuals are better at understanding economic cycles better? Maybe they should be the ones allocating weights for you instead? 

### **3) Interaction Skill**

For example, if you had superior selection skills (you are great at picking stocks in the industry) and overweighted that particular industry (you knew this industry would go up), the interaction effect would be positive! 

If you had superior selection, but underweighted that industry (you thought this industry would go down) , the interaction effect would be negative.

In this case, you did not take advantage of the superior selection by allocating more assets to that industry. 

To reach financial freedom, and make as much money as you can, you must understand how good you are at picking stocks in each industry, and how good you are at forecasting which industry will be going up.

Do you know your strengths? Do you know who to ask for help on things you're not so good at? Don't worry, we are here to help you!


## **The Math behind**

In HelloStocker App, your AI Financial Advisor can segment your portfolio with respect to many metrics: stock fundamentals such as value, growth, P/E ratio, and other financial metrics such as Short Ratio, as well as Popularity and Social metrics.


Again, for simplicity, let's assume the segmentation is done by industry. Our benchmark here is the S&P: the index that replicate the US market.


We list below the calculation methodologies, a positive figure means you are skilled, the higher the number the more skilled you are.


### **1) Selection Skill**



The selection effect measures the investor's ability to select securities within a given
industry relative to the SP500. A positive selection effect occurs for a particular industry when our portfolio return is greater than the benchmark return.


The Selection Effect for the Technology industry is calculated using the below metrics and formula:



* \-  The Technology industry weight in the SP500
* \-  The Technology industry return of the SP500
* \-  The Technology industry return of our Portfolio

$$ {SP500_{Weight}}^{TechnologyIndustry} \times ({{Portfolio_{Return}}^{TechnologyStocks}} - {SP500_{Return}}^{TechnologyIndustry}) $$

### **2) Allocation Skill**


The allocation effect measures the investor's ability to effectively allocate their portfolio's assets to various industries.
Positive allocation occurs when the portfolio is overweighted in an industry that outperforms the SP500 and underweighted in
an industry that underperforms the SP500.


The Allocation Effect for the Technology industry with respect to our investor's portfolio is calculated using the below metrics and formula:



* \-  The Technology industry weight in our Portfolio
* \-  The Technology industry weight in the SP500
* \-  The Technology industry return of the SP500
* \-  The total return of the SP500

$$ ({{Portfolio_{Weight}}^{TechnologyStocks}} - {SP500_{Weight}}^{TechnologyIndustry}) \times  ({SP500_{Return}^{TechnologyIndustry}} - {SP500_{TotalReturn}}) $$  


### **3) Interaction Skill**


If you are good at selecting stocks for a particular industry, you should overallocate the weight of this industry in your portfolio.

A positive interaction effect on the technology industry would occur for instance when both of the following conditions are met:  

* \-  the investor's portfolio weight in the technology industry was greater than the SP500 weight in the same industry,
* \-  the investor's portfolio return for the technology industry was greater than the SP500 return for the same industry.

In this scenario, the investor exercised good selection and overallocated assets to that segment.

The interaction effect would also be positive if the investor underweighted the industries for which he underperformed because of poor selection skills.

The Interaction Effect for the Technology industry with respect to our investor's portfolio is calculated using the below metrics and formula:



* \-  The Technology industry weight in our Portfolio
* \-  The Technology industry return of our Portfolio
* \-  The Technology industry weight in the SP500
* \-  The Technology industry return of the SP500

$$ ({{Portfolio_{Weight}}^{TechnologyStocks}} - {SP500_{Weight}}^{TechnologyIndustry}) \times  ({Portfolio_{Return}^{TechnologyStocks}} - {SP500_{Return}^{TechnologyIndustry}}) $$       


## **Know your strengths: outperform the market**

The sum of all these effects is equal to the difference between your Portfolio Performance and the Market Performance: this is your 'Active Return', often referred as 'Excess Return' over the market.

Your active return explain how well you are doing over the market and why:

* \-  How good you are at selecting stocks
* \-  How good you are at allocating your positions
* \-  How good you know your overall strengths and manage the interaction effect of allocating and selecting stocks

When you know where your performance comes from, you can build an efficient strategy that will allow you to consistently beat the market.

These metrics are calculated for you in HelloStocker App for stocks and cryptos.
