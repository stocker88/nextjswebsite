### A) Bitcoin Calendar

&nbsp;


#### 1) Major Bitcoin Surges:

&nbsp;

&nbsp; - 2013 Surge: 

&nbsp;

In April 2013, Bitcoin's price surged from around $100 to over $1,000 within a few months, marking one of its first significant price rallies.

&nbsp;

&nbsp; - 2020-2021 Bull Run:

&nbsp;

Starting in late 2020 and continuing into early 2021, Bitcoin's price surged to new all-time highs, reaching around $60,000 in April 2021.

&nbsp;

#### 2) Major Bitcoin Crashes:

&nbsp;

&nbsp; - December 2017 - February 2018: 

&nbsp;

After reaching an all-time high near $20,000 in December 2017, Bitcoin underwent a significant correction, dropping to around $6,000 by early February 2018.

&nbsp;

&nbsp; - March 2020: 

&nbsp;

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, global markets experienced a sharp decline, and Bitcoin's price dropped from around $9,000 to nearly $4,000 within a couple of days in mid-March 2020.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;- May 2021: 

&nbsp;

Following Elon Musk's announcement that Tesla would no longer accept Bitcoin as payment due to environmental concerns, Bitcoin's price plummeted from around $55,000 to below $30,000 within a few weeks.


&nbsp;

#### 3) Bitcoin Halving

&nbsp;

Bitcoin halving is an event programmed into the Bitcoin protocol that occurs approximately every four years, or after every 210,000 blocks mined. 

&nbsp;

During a halving, the rewards that miners receive for validating transactions and adding blocks to the blockchain are halved.

&nbsp;

The purpose of halving is to control the issuance rate of new Bitcoins, gradually reducing the rate at which new coins are created. 

&nbsp;

This mechanism ensures that the total supply of Bitcoin remains capped at 21 million coins, making it a deflationary asset.

&nbsp;

The Bitcoin halving events have taken place as follows:

&nbsp;

&nbsp; - November 28, 2012 (First Halving): The initial reward of 50 Bitcoins per block was reduced to 25 Bitcoins.

&nbsp;

&nbsp; - July 9, 2016 (Second Halving): The block reward decreased from 25 Bitcoins to 12.5 Bitcoins.

&nbsp;

&nbsp; - May 11, 2020 (Third Halving): The block reward was further reduced from 12.5 Bitcoins to 6.25 Bitcoins.

&nbsp;

&nbsp; - The next Bitcoin halving is expected to occur approximately four years after the 2020 halving, in 2024.

&nbsp;

&nbsp; - During this event, the block reward will be halved again, reducing the reward to 3.125 Bitcoins per block.

&nbsp;

Halvings are significant events in the Bitcoin ecosystem as they impact the supply and potentially influence the asset's value.

&nbsp;

The reduction in the rate of new Bitcoin creation often leads to discussions about its potential effects on the market dynamics and price.

&nbsp;

Bitcoin price prediction is aiming for a high target at $1,000,000 (yes Million) and mid price at $200,000.  

&nbsp;

This price prediction takes into account the effect of halving, but also social trend analysis explained below, and macro economics and current inflation rates.

&nbsp;

### B) Social Trends Analysis

&nbsp;

Based on the available Social data for Bitcoin, here are three key points and interesting statistics:

&nbsp;

&nbsp; 1. Increasing Social Score

&nbsp;

The social score for BTC-USD has been steadily increasing over time.


&nbsp;

This indicates a growing interest and engagement from the online community in Bitcoin.

&nbsp;

It suggests that more people are discussing and sharing information about Bitcoin, which could impact its price and market sentiment.

&nbsp;

&nbsp; 2. Volatility and Price Fluctuations

&nbsp;

Bitcoin has been known for its high volatility, and this is reflected in its price fluctuations

&nbsp;

The price of BTC-USD has experienced significant ups and downs, making it an attractive investment option for traders seeking opportunities for profit

&nbsp;

However, it also poses risks for investors due to the potential for sudden price drops.

&nbsp;

&nbsp; 3. Long-term Growth

&nbsp;

Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has shown long-term growth.


&nbsp;

Over the analyzed period, the price of BTC-USD has steadily increased, indicating a positive trend.

&nbsp;

This growth can be attributed to factors such as increasing adoption, institutional interest, and limited supply.

&nbsp;

However, it's important to note that past performance is not indicative of future results.

&nbsp;

Regardless, Bitcoin price prediction is an agglomeration of multiple effects that adds up and increase the likelihood to see a 7 digit price.

&nbsp;

Social Trend is positive, but social hype (chances of the trend being a bubble) is actually low.


&nbsp;

Most of current flow is coming from the ETF indexation (that was released last October).


&nbsp;


Since then, many funds and big investors started buying Bitcoin with long term views.


&nbsp;


We are not dealing with day traders / speculators anymore. 


&nbsp;


We see serious investors putting part of their retirement in the cryptocurrency.


&nbsp;

We wouldn’t be surprised if Bitcoin reaches $400,000 in 2024.


&nbsp;

This price prediction takes into account the halving coming this year.

There could be a greater social buzz around the halving event.

### D) Bitcoin Opportunities and Risks

&nbsp;

Bitcoin is the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, while the US Dollar is the world's primary reserve currency.

&nbsp;

Bitcoin has gained significant attention and popularity in recent years due to its decentralized nature, limited supply, and potential as a store of value and medium of exchange.

&nbsp;

Investing or trading in BTC-USD can offer several opportunities

&nbsp;

#### &nbsp; 1. Potential for high returns

&nbsp;

Bitcoin has experienced significant price appreciation over the years, with some investors earning substantial profits.

&nbsp;

The volatile nature of Bitcoin can create opportunities for traders to profit from price movements.

&nbsp;

#### &nbsp; 2. Diversification

&nbsp;

Adding Bitcoin to an investment portfolio can provide diversification benefits.

&nbsp;

Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies overall have a low correlation with traditional asset classes like stocks and bonds.

&nbsp;

This can help reduce overall portfolio risk.

&nbsp;

#### &nbsp; 3. Global accessibility

&nbsp;

Bitcoin can be bought and sold by anyone with an internet connection, making it accessible to individuals worldwide.

&nbsp;

This global accessibility can open up investment opportunities for people in countries with limited financial infrastructure.


&nbsp;

However, investing or trading in BTC-USD also carries certain risks.

&nbsp;

#### &nbsp; 1. Volatility

&nbsp;

Bitcoin is known for its price volatility, with significant price swings occurring within short periods.

&nbsp;

This volatility can lead to substantial gains but also significant losses.

&nbsp;

Investors should be prepared for the possibility of large price fluctuations.

&nbsp;

#### &nbsp; 2. Regulatory risks

&nbsp;

The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, and governments around the world are implementing various regulations to govern their use.

&nbsp;

Changes in regulations can impact the value and legality of Bitcoin, potentially affecting its price.

&nbsp;

#### &nbsp; 3. Security risks

&nbsp;

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are stored in digital wallets, which can be vulnerable to hacking and theft.

&nbsp;

Investors must take precautions to secure their wallets and protect their Bitcoin holdings.

&nbsp;



&nbsp;


&nbsp;

Bitcoin trading flows are not from retail this time, now they come mostly from funds (it’s not a bubble).

&nbsp;

This is mostly due to the ETF indexation, this rally is a slow and sure rally.

&nbsp;

We wouldn’t be surprised if Bitcoin reaches $200k in 2024.


&nbsp;

This adds up to the halving coming this year.

&nbsp;

There could be a greater social buzz around the halving event.

&nbsp;

Stay focused and keep tracking the Social Hype Indicator to know when to sell.
