If you save $10 a day:
 
\- in 10 years, you will have **$36,000**

\- in 20 years, you will have **$90,000**

&nbsp;

If you save $10 a day, and invest it with 10% return:

\- in 10 years, you will have **$62,000**

\- in 20 years, you will have **$600,000!**

&nbsp;  

If you save $20 (not $10) a day, and invest it with 10% return:

\- in 10 years, you will have **$160,000**

\- in 20 years, you will have **$2,000,000!**

&nbsp;  


You would be surprised to know how many high income earners making over $100,000 are living pay check to pay check because they have no money management skills.

&nbsp;  

They only know how to spend: that's it.

&nbsp;  

There are 2 main factors that contribute to whether you will be rich or not.

&nbsp;  

It’s not how much money you make: it's not your job.

&nbsp;  

Especially not when 55% of your income goes in taxes.

&nbsp;  

And it's not by taking a mortgage at 10% interest either.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

## 1. Trade off your instincts for rational thinking

&nbsp;  

In the history of mankind, money was not such a thing. 

&nbsp;  

People used to take logical decisions based on their instinct.

&nbsp;  

People would seek pleasures: PLEASURES.

&nbsp;  

80% of people don’t even look at prices when they go out.

&nbsp;  

Most of us have no barrier check: we just want to enjoy.

&nbsp;  

We go for whatever gives us the «easiest / quickest» form of pleasure.

&nbsp;  

**Money did not exist for over 99% of men’s existence - our instincts have not adapted.**

&nbsp;  

The concepts of money management, compound interest, personal finance, budgeting and investing were inexistent. 

&nbsp;  

We did not need money saving hacks, there was no retirement, no stocks or real estate to invest in.

&nbsp;  


Financial freedom were not even a concept: all we had is **our instincts**.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

## 2. Warren Buffett started investing at 11 years old

&nbsp;  
Health matters most.

&nbsp;  
Love is second.

&nbsp;  
What comes third? 

&nbsp;  
That expensive dinner? 

&nbsp;  
Or the luxurious car you saw on Social Media?

&nbsp;  

Money. 

&nbsp;  

Money comes third.

&nbsp;    

Apart from Health and Love, there is not much you can’t afford without money.


&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## 3. Understand the math behind Compounding

&nbsp;

There is no easy trick without a mathematical formula, you don’t need to be a genius with a financial education to understand what is compounding.

&nbsp;

Compounding is like a snowball effect for your money.

&nbsp;

\- You start with some money, say $100.

&nbsp;

\- You invest it, and it earns you more money over time, let's say $5.

&nbsp;

\- Instead of taking that $5 out, you leave it with your original $100.

&nbsp;

\- Now, your total is $105, and your next earnings are calculated based on this larger amount.

&nbsp;

\- This keeps happening, and your money keeps growing faster and faster.

&nbsp;

\- It makes your wealth grow exponentially.

If you save $10 a day:

\- in 10 years, you will have **$36,000**

\- in 20 years, you will have **$90,000**

&nbsp;  

If you save $10 a day, and invest it with 10% return:

\- in 10 years, you will have **$62,000**

\- in 20 years, you will have **$600,000**


&nbsp;

**If you save $20 a day, and invest it with 15% return:**

\- in 10 years, you will have **$160,000**

\- in 20 years, you will have **$2,000,000**

&nbsp;

Compound growth is like a money-making snowball that gets bigger as it rolls, thanks to the money it picks up along the way.

&nbsp;

Warren Buffett was a kid hustling for pennies during the Depression, and at 11 years old in 1942, he launched his lifelong love of investing when he bought his first stock. 

&nbsp;

Three shares of an oil company called Cities Service at about $38 each. He sold his shares soon after at $40 each.

&nbsp;

His first trade: he invested $114 and made $6. Today he manages $270,636,932,292: $270 Billions.

&nbsp;
