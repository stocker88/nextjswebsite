&nbsp;

If you invest $1,000 a month it takes 4 years to reach $100,000

&nbsp;

But it only takes 2 years to grow from $700,000 to $1,000,000!

&nbsp;

Eventually you will reach a point your money makes more money.

 
&nbsp;  




## 2. The math behind Compounding

&nbsp;

Compounding is like a snowball effect for your money.

&nbsp;

\- You start with some money, say $100.

&nbsp;

\- You invest it, and it earns you more money over time, let's say $5.

&nbsp;

\- Instead of taking that $5 out, you leave it with your original $100.

&nbsp;

\- Now, your total is $105, and your next earnings are calculated based on this larger amount.

&nbsp;

\- This keeps happening, and your money keeps growing faster and faster.

&nbsp;

\- It makes your wealth grow exponentially.

&nbsp;  

If you save $10 a day:

\- in 10 years, you will have **$36,000**

\- in 20 years, you will have **$90,000**

&nbsp;  

If you save $10 a day, and invest it with 10% return:

\- in 10 years, you will have **$62,000**

\- in 20 years, you will have **$600,000**


&nbsp;

**If you save $20 a day, and invest it with 15% return:**

\- in 10 years, you will have **$160,000**

\- in 20 years, you will have **$2,000,000**

&nbsp;

Compound growth is like a money-making snowball that gets bigger as it rolls, thanks to the money it picks up along the way.

&nbsp;

Warren Buffett was a kid hustling for pennies during the Depression, and at 11 years old in 1942, he launched his lifelong love of investing when he bought his first stock. 

&nbsp;

Three shares of an oil company called Cities Service at about $38 each. He sold his shares soon after at $40 each.

&nbsp;

His first trade: he invested $114 and made $6. 

&nbsp;

Today he manages $301,636,932,292! $301 Billions

&nbsp;

## Start Early

&nbsp;

If you had saved and invested this money by age 11, just like Warren Buffett did, and knew about compound interest, how much money do you think you would have today? 

&nbsp;

Would you be a Millionaire by now?
