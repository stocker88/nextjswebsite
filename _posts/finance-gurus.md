## 1) How Trading Gurus Get Paid


&nbsp;

The Guru makes money with trading!

&nbsp;

**Not with his trading, with yours.**

&nbsp;


\- 1) 🚘The Guru shows you expensive cars rented in Dubai

&nbsp;

\- 2) 📈The Guru makes you believe you see him trade live

&nbsp;

\- 3) ✅The Guru convinces you he makes money with trading and pushes you to trade

&nbsp;

\- 4) The Guru is generous and offers to give you $200 if you start trading with them

&nbsp;

\- 5) 🚀You open an account with his affiliate broker and deposit $1,000 to trade

&nbsp;

\- 6) 🧐The affiliate pays your Guru $600: wait and what about you?

&nbsp;

\- 7) 🤯The Guru pushes you to day trade and take 50% commissions on your trades

&nbsp;


&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Your Guru influencer gets paid $600 when they convince you to trade, but wait for it...

&nbsp;

## **The Guru wants you to trade everyday so he can take half your commissions!**  

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Be a day trader!

&nbsp;

### **He doesn't tell you short term trades are taxed 40%**

&nbsp;

You can do the math quick: unless you live in Puerto Rico, your commissions and taxes will eat all your gains.



&nbsp;


### **Long term investing is taxed 20%**

&nbsp;

But since he gets paid on having you trade everyday, he will push you to do it: the Guru comes first.

### **Pretty good business isn't it?**

&nbsp;

They want you to buy and trade fast.

&nbsp;

Buy Sell Buy Sell... burn your money on commissions! The rest goes to taxes.

&nbsp;

It's not about trading lots: it's about picking the few good trades that pay big.

&nbsp;

Why? Because short term trade gains are taxed 40%.

&nbsp;

Long term trade gains are taxed 20% (hold for over a year).

&nbsp;

## 2 things I learnt from my 15 years in investing?

&nbsp;

**🦄 Social influencers and 'Finance Gurus' don't make money with their trading: they make money with your trading.**

&nbsp;

**🧠 There are smart way for you to profit from long term investing.**

&nbsp;


I was part of the investing team for Goldman Sachs Asset Management office in New York City...

&nbsp;

Managing my own multi billion dollars book on Kerviel's ex trading desk...

&nbsp;

Building automated trading for Bank of America in London...

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## **How can I help you?**


&nbsp;

My parents grew up in wealthy families and moved to France as political refugees when I was 3: I grew up with nothing apart from love and good values.

&nbsp;

Thanks to my investments and hard work in prestigious banks, I now have the luxury to own a $100m2 flat in Paris (le Marais) and a flat in London (Covent Garden).

&nbsp;

The goal: Empower you with smart investment decisions to make your money work.

&nbsp;

I don't care if you make $1,000 or $10,000 a month: what matters is for you to grow your wealth 💸

&nbsp;

We'll shake hands and exchange ideas when we meet!

&nbsp;

There is no better feeling than helping others. Remember: money is the tool, not the goal.

## 2) How to differentiate the Advisor from the Guru Influencer?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### **A) Ask your Financial Guru to trade live in HelloStocker**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

❌\- Influencer : 'But why HelloStocker? I already have my setup'

&nbsp;

✅\- You : 'Because HelloStocker is not your broker.'

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


❌\- Influencer : 'But I already trade live'

&nbsp;

✅\- You : 'How do we know it's actually live?'


✅\- You : 'How do we know we see all your trades?'


✅\- You : 'How do we track your real profits?'

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


❌\- Influencer : 'I don't want to put money in this app'

&nbsp;

✅\- You : 'HelloStocker doesn't take money.'


✅\- You : 'It gives you free virtual money - as much as you want.'

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

❌\- Influencer : 'I don't have time for you'

&nbsp;  

❌\- Influencer : 'I would rather go scam someone who trusts me'

&nbsp;

✅\- You : 'Well I know, scammer' -> leave a comment and share this link on his posts.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


### **B) Ask them how they make money**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

❌\- Influencer : 'I make money with trading'

&nbsp;

✅\- You : 'Ok show me on HelloStocker then.'

&nbsp;

❌\- Influencer : 'I will show you how on telegram'

&nbsp;

✅\- You : 'There is no virtual trading on telegram'

&nbsp;

❌\- Influencer : 'I show you with my broker'

&nbsp;

✅\- You : 'Why not In HelloStocker?' (back to point A)

&nbsp;

❌\- Influencer : 'I don't have time for you' 

❌\- Influencer : 'I would rather scam someone who trusts me'

&nbsp;

✅\- You : 'Well I know, you're an influencer, not an advisor.'

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
