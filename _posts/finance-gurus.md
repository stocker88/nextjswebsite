In this article we will:

&nbsp;

\-**1)** Explain how finance gurus make money

&nbsp;

\-**2)** Use their weakness to differentiate genuine advisors from scammers!


&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## 1) How Trading Gurus Get Paid



&nbsp;

![](/assets/blog/financial-gurus/how_trading_gurus_make_money.webp)

&nbsp;



**1) They give you free trading courses**

&nbsp;

**2) 🚘They show you how rich they are**

&nbsp;

**3) 📈They make you believe you see them trade live**

&nbsp;

**4) And even if they do, you won't see ALL their trades** 

&nbsp;

**5) ✅They convince you it works and push you to trade**

&nbsp;

**6) They offer to give you $200 if you start trading with them**

&nbsp;

**7) 🚀You open an account with their affiliate broker and deposit $1,000**

&nbsp;

**8) 🧐Their affiliate pays them $600**

&nbsp;

**9) 💸They just got paid $600 - done.**

&nbsp;

**10) 💀Wait I forgot - now they want you to bring your friend.**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

They get paid $600 when they convince you to trade!

&nbsp;

If they get 1,000 people a month to trade...

&nbsp;

That's $600,000 a month:

&nbsp;

**→ $7,200,000 a year.**

&nbsp;

**BINGO**

&nbsp;

This is how they make money with trading!

&nbsp;

**Not with their trading, with yours.**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


### **Pretty good business isn't it?**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

They show you their lamborghini.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Meanwhile you lose your $1,000** 

&nbsp;

What happens then?

&nbsp;

**Nothing, you just lost your money.**

&nbsp;

They don't care about you.

&nbsp;

They want you to buy and trade fast.

&nbsp;

A Finance Guru with a million followers, but no LinkedIn.

&nbsp;

**A Financial Guru with no experience in investing.**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


💸 Have you ever wondered how financial gurus get paid?
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**📚One thing I learnt from my 15 years in investing?**

&nbsp;

**🦄 Social influencers are not investors.**

&nbsp;

**🙄 You can't get rich on whatsapp.**

&nbsp;

**🧞 Even the best trader will not turn $1 into $100 in 5 days.**

&nbsp;

**🧠 But there is a smart way to make money.**

&nbsp;

Trust me, I have 10 followers on instagram.


&nbsp;

My marketing s*** because I was busy with building on investing skills.


&nbsp;

Investing for Goldman Sachs Asset Management office in New York City...

&nbsp;

Managing my own multi billion dollars book on Kerviel's ex trading desk...

&nbsp;

Building automated trading for Bank of America in London...

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## **Why I don't do that?**

&nbsp;

I don't hide in Dubai. I have a LinkedIn profile, my name is public.

&nbsp;

I come from nothing, I was a political refugee when my parents moved to Paris at the age of 3.

&nbsp;

And today I own a $100m2 flat in Paris (le Marais) and a flat in London (Covent Garden), thanks to my investments and hard work.

&nbsp;

The goal: empower people with smart investment choices.

&nbsp;

Not push them to trade fast and open an account with Robinhood eToro or whatever broker.

&nbsp;

Facts: after your first 2 millions, money doesn't buy happiness, purpose does.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## 2) How to differentiate the Advisor from the Influencer?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

That one is easy!

&nbsp;

You can follow these 2 steps:

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### **A) Ask your Financial Guru to trade live in HelloStocker**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

❌\- 'But why HelloStocker? I already have my setup'

&nbsp;

✅Because HelloStocker is not your broker.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


❌\- 'But I already trade live'

&nbsp;

✅How do we know it's actually live?


✅How do we know we see all your trades?


✅How do we track your real profits?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


❌\- 'I don't want to put money in this app'

&nbsp;

✅HelloStocker doesn't take money.


✅It gives you free virtual money - as much as you want.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

❌\- 'I don't have time for you'

&nbsp;  

❌\- 'I would rather go scam someone who trusts me'

&nbsp;

✅Well I know, scammer -> share the link in his comments.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


### **B) Ask them how they make money**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

❌\- 'I make money with trading'

&nbsp;

✅Ok show me on HelloStocker then.

&nbsp;

❌\- 'I will show you how on telegram'

&nbsp;

✅There is no virtual trading on telegram

&nbsp;

❌\- 'I show you with my broker'

&nbsp;

✅Go back to point A)...

&nbsp;

❌\- 'I don't have time for you' 

❌\- 'I would rather scam someone who trusts me'

&nbsp;

✅Well I know, you're an influencer, not an advisor.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


## 3) So how does HelloStocker make money?

&nbsp;
