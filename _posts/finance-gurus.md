Ever wondered how financial gurus get paid?

I worked 15 years as a trader.

Investing for Goldman Sachs Asset Management office in New York City.

Managing my own multi billion dollars book on Kerviel's ex trading desk.

Building automated trading for Bank of America in London.

**One thing I learnt from my 15 years in investing?**

\- **There is no money magician.**

\- **You can't dig gold out of air.**

\- **Jesus Christ doesn't trade yet.**

\- **No genie will turn your $1 into $100 in 30 days.**

\- **But there is a smart way to make money.**
 
In this article we will:

\-**1)** Cover how finance gurus make money

\-**2)** Use their weakness to differentiate genuine advisors from scammers!


## **How Trading Gurus Get Paid**

10 steps:

\-**1) They give you free trading courses**

\-**2) They show you how rich they are**

\-**3) They make you believe you see them trade live**

\-**4) And even if they do, you won't see ALL their trades** 

\-**5) They convince you it works and push you to trade**

\-**6) They offer to give you $200 if you start trading with them**

\-**7) You open an account with their affiliate broker and deposit $1,000**

\-**8) Their affiliate pays them $600**

\-**9) They just got paid $600 - done.**

\-**10) Wait I forgot - now they want you to bring your friend.**

They get paid $600 when they convince you to trade!

If they get 1,000 people a month to trade...

That's $600,000 a month:

\-**$7,200,000 a year.**

Pretty good business isn't it?

How do I know that? 

I know a bunch of them.

They show you their lamborghini.

And they make you believe they made this money with trading.

**But what happens when you lose your $1,000?** 

**Nothing, you just lost your money.**

They don't care about you.

You just got scammed.

By a Finance Guru with no LinkedIn.

**A Financial Guru with no experience in investing.**

**Why don't I do that?**

Because I don't live in Dubai.

I have a LinkedIn profile, my name is public.

**If I scam you I can't escape.**

And I'm happy to meet up if you want to!

I host meetups in New York, London, and Paris.


## **How to differentiate the Advisor from the Scammer?**

That one is easy!

You can follow these 2 steps:

## **1) Ask the influencer you trust so much to trade live in HelloStocker**

\- 'But why HelloStocker? I already have my setup'

Because HelloStocker is not your broker.


\- 'But I already trade live'

How do we know it's actually live?

How do we know we see all your trades?

How do we track your real profits?


\- 'I don't want to put money in this app'

HelloStocker doesn't take money.

It gives you free virtual money - as much as you want.

HelloStocker doesn't allow you to open a trading account with them or anyone.

You can't make real trades with HelloStocker.

You either practice virtually to learn.

Or you trade virtually to show others what you are capable of.

\- 'I don't have time for you, I would rather go scam someone who trusts me'

Well I know, scammer.


## **2) Ask them how they make money**

\- 'I make money with trading'

Ok show me on HelloStocker then.

(go back to 1)

\- 'I will show you how on telegram'

There is no virtual trading on telegram

\- 'I show you with my broker'

Go back to 1

\- 'I don't have time for you, I would rather go scam someone who trusts me'

Well I know, scammer.
