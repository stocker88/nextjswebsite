## 1) How Trading Gurus Get Paid


&nbsp;

The Guru makes money with trading!

&nbsp;

**Not with his trading, with yours.**

&nbsp;


\- 1) 🚘The Guru shows you expensive cars rented in Dubai

&nbsp;

\- 2) 📈The Guru makes you believe you see him trade live

&nbsp;

\- 3) ✅The Guru convinces you he makes money with trading and pushes you to trade

&nbsp;

\- 4) The Guru is generous and offers to give you $200 if you start trading with them

&nbsp;

\- 5) 🚀You open an account with his affiliate broker and deposit $1,000 to trade

&nbsp;

\- 6) 🧐The affiliate pays your Guru $600: wait and what about you?

&nbsp;

\- 7) 🤯The Guru pushes you to day trade and take 50% commissions on your trades

&nbsp;


&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Your Guru influencer gets paid $600 when they convince you to trade, but wait for it...

&nbsp;

## **The Guru wants you to trade everyday so he can take half your commissions!**  

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Be a day trader!

&nbsp;

### **He doesn't tell you short term trades are taxed 40%**

&nbsp;

You can do the math quick: unless you live in Puerto Rico, your commissions and taxes will eat all your gains.



&nbsp;


### **Long term investing is taxed 20%**

&nbsp;

But since he gets paid on having you trade everyday, he will push you to do it: the Guru comes first.

### **Pretty good business isn't it?**

&nbsp;

They want you to buy and trade fast.

&nbsp;

Buy Sell Buy Sell... burn your money on commissions! The rest goes to taxes.

&nbsp;

It's not about trading lots: it's about picking the few good trades that pay big.

&nbsp;

Why? Because short term trade gains are taxed 40%.

&nbsp;

Long term trade gains are taxed 20% (hold for over a year).


&nbsp;
