&nbsp;

## 1) How Trading Gurus Get Paid


&nbsp;

The Guru makes money with trading!

&nbsp;

**Not with his trading, with yours.**

&nbsp;


\- 1) The Guru shows you expensive cars rented in Dubai

&nbsp;

\- 2) The Guru convinces you he makes money with trading and pushes you to trade

&nbsp;

\- 3) You open an account with his affiliate broker and deposit $1,000 to trade

&nbsp;

\- 4) üßêThe affiliate pays your Guru $600

&nbsp;

\- 5) ü§ØThe Guru pushes you to day trade and take 50% commissions on your trades

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## **The Guru wants you to trade everyday so he can take half your commissions!**  

&nbsp;

You can do the math quick: unless you live in Puerto Rico, your commissions and taxes will eat all your gains.

&nbsp;

Long term investing is taxed 20%**
