## 1) How Trading Gurus Get Paid


&nbsp;

The Guru makes money with trading!

&nbsp;

**Not with his trading, with yours.**

&nbsp;



\- 1) The Guru gives you free trading courses

&nbsp;

\- 2) üöòThe Guru shows you expensive cars rented in Dubai

&nbsp;

\- 3) üìàThe Guru makes you believe you see him trade live

&nbsp;

\- 4) And even if he does, you won't see ALL his trades 

&nbsp;

\- 5) ‚úÖThe Guru convinces you he make money with trading and pushes you to trade

&nbsp;

\- 6) The Guru is generous and offers to give you $200 if you start trading with them

&nbsp;

\- 7) üöÄYou open an account with his affiliate broker and deposit $1,000 to trade

&nbsp;

\- 8) üßêThe affiliate pays your Guru $600: wait and what about you?

&nbsp;

\- 9) üí∏The Guru makes you trade everyday and take commissions on your trades

&nbsp;

\- 10) üíÄWait I forgot - now he wants you to bring your friends.

&nbsp;


&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Your Guru influencer gets paid $600 when they convince you to trade!

&nbsp;

If they get 1,000 people a month to trade... That's $600,000 a month: **‚Üí $7,200,000 a year.**


&nbsp;


### **The Guru wants you to trade everyday: he will make even more money!**  

&nbsp;

And now he wants you to trade everyday! Be a day trader!

&nbsp;

He takes 50% of all your trading commissions.

&nbsp;

Who cares you will make money right?

&nbsp;

### **He doesn't tell you short term trades get taxed 40%**

&nbsp;

You can do the math quick: unless you live in Puerto Rico, your commissions and taxes will eat all your gains.



&nbsp;


### **Long term investing gets taxed 20%**

&nbsp;

But since he gets paid on having you trade everyday, he will push you to do it.

&nbsp;

And burn your money: meanwhile he gets paid!

&nbsp;


### **Pretty good business isn't it?**

&nbsp;

They want you to buy and trade fast.

&nbsp;

Buy Sell Buy Sell burn your money on commissions!

&nbsp;

It's not about trading lots: it's about picking the few good trades that pay big.

&nbsp;

Why? Because short term trade gains are taxed 40%.

&nbsp;

Long term trade gains are taxed 20% (hold for over a year).


&nbsp;


&nbsp;

## One thing I learnt from my 15 years in investing?**

&nbsp;

**ü¶Ñ Social influencers are not investors.**

&nbsp;

**üôÑ You can't get rich on whatsapp.**

&nbsp;

**üßû Even the best trader will not turn $1 into $100 in 5 days.**

&nbsp;

**üß† But there is a smart way to make money.**

&nbsp;


I was part of the investing team for Goldman Sachs Asset Management office in New York City...

&nbsp;

Managing my own multi billion dollars book on Kerviel's ex trading desk...

&nbsp;

Building automated trading for Bank of America in London...

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## **I am not a financial Guru, why?**


&nbsp;

I come from nothing, I was a political refugee when my parents moved to Paris at the age of 3.

&nbsp;

And today I own a $100m2 flat in Paris (le Marais) and a flat in London (Covent Garden), thanks to my investments and hard work.

&nbsp;

The goal: empower people with smart investment choices. Not get into a get richer quick scheme.

&nbsp;

I don't care if you trade with Robinhood eToro or whatever broker.

&nbsp;

I want you to learn how to invest, find the right opportunities, make big money, and shake my hands when we meet.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

After your first 2 millions, personal finance and money doesn't buy anymore happiness, but purpose and social reward does.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## 2) How to differentiate the Advisor from the Guru Influencer?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### **A) Ask your Financial Guru to trade live in HelloStocker**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

‚ùå\- Influencer : 'But why HelloStocker? I already have my setup'

&nbsp;

‚úÖ\- You : 'Because HelloStocker is not your broker.'

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


‚ùå\- Influencer : 'But I already trade live'

&nbsp;

‚úÖ\- You : 'How do we know it's actually live?'


‚úÖ\- You : 'How do we know we see all your trades?'


‚úÖ\- You : 'How do we track your real profits?'

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


‚ùå\- Influencer : 'I don't want to put money in this app'

&nbsp;

‚úÖ\- You : 'HelloStocker doesn't take money.'


‚úÖ\- You : 'It gives you free virtual money - as much as you want.'

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

‚ùå\- Influencer : 'I don't have time for you'

&nbsp;  

‚ùå\- Influencer : 'I would rather go scam someone who trusts me'

&nbsp;

‚úÖ\- You : 'Well I know, scammer' -> leave a comment and share this link on his posts.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


### **B) Ask them how they make money**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

‚ùå\- Influencer : 'I make money with trading'

&nbsp;

‚úÖ\- You : 'Ok show me on HelloStocker then.'

&nbsp;

‚ùå\- Influencer : 'I will show you how on telegram'

&nbsp;

‚úÖ\- You : 'There is no virtual trading on telegram'

&nbsp;

‚ùå\- Influencer : 'I show you with my broker'

&nbsp;

‚úÖ\- You : 'Why not In HelloStocker?' (back to point A)

&nbsp;

‚ùå\- Influencer : 'I don't have time for you' 

‚ùå\- Influencer : 'I would rather scam someone who trusts me'

&nbsp;

‚úÖ\- You : 'Well I know, you're an influencer, not an advisor.'

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
