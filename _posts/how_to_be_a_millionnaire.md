You don’t need to make $300k to be rich, in fact it’s the opposite most of people I know who work and make $300k have almost no savings and no investments.

Warren Buffett was a kid hustling for pennies during the Depression, and at 11 years old in 1942, he launched his lifelong love of investing when he bought his first stock — three shares of an oil company called Cities Service at about $38 each. He sold his shares soon after at $40 each.

There are 2 main factors that contribute to whether someone will be rich or not, it’s not how smart they are, how much money they have.

This is backed up by data, over 10,000 people have filled a survey in our app, that showed the following: wealth is not correlated to earnings, in fact, these 2 main factors that have nothing to do with income.

Most of people put a barrier in their mind, but not the right ones unfortunately. Just like when you skip the gym, they look for short term gratifications over dedication and long term health.

The brain by default is designed to seek pleasures, and in the pursuit of pleasures we forget what’s the most important.

## 1. Money doesn't matter

Health matters the most, it comes first, being healthy, being safe, even wonder why military and healthcare budgets are so high? Now you know.

Love comes second, our specie is a very social species, the need for social interaction is what made, Instagram TikTok and other social platforms so famous.

What comes third? That expensive steak you can’t afford? Or that luxurious car that costs more than your flat?

Money. Money comes third, because there isn’t much else you can’t afford without money.

80% of people don’t even look at prices when they go out, they don’t have a barrier check, and when they do, they don’t compare prices logically, they go for whatever gives them the « easy » pleasure: by the way that bottle of water just costed you $10, more than our budgeting course.

Warren Buffet had pennies, he understood what comes third is money, and this can be done with 2 easy steps.

## 2. Trade off your animal instincts for rational thinking

In the history of mankind, money was not such a thing. People used to take logical decisions based on their instinct.

It’s not very logical is it? It was at the time, but not today.

People would take whatever brings them the most pleasures, these same instincts that developed so many wars, disasters and others, are the same ones that ruin your chances of success, by pushing you to think about short term pleasures, just like kids, for good and belongings that will dissipate over time.

**Money has not been a thing and did not exist for over 99% of men’s existence, it came only very recently and our genes and way of thinking have not adapted yet.**

The concepts of Money Management, Saving Money, Financial Planning, Personal Finance, Budgeting and Investing were all inexistent. We did not need any money saving hacks, there was no credit score, no retirement or real estate, all we had to do is **follow our instincts**.

Think about how much expensive restaurants you’ve been to, how much worthless pairs of shoes you have? How much clothes you don’t wear in your wardrobe? How many dates cost you money and didn’t go as expected? How many times you’ve spent money to please others before thinking about yourself first?

## 3. Understand the math behind Compounding

There is no easy trick without a mathematical formula, you don’t need to be a genius with a financial education to understand what is compounding, and yet someone uninformed about finance probably never heard the term before.

Compounding is like a snowball effect for your money.

- You start with some money, say $100.

- You invest it, and it earns you more money over time, let's say $5.

- Instead of taking that $5 out, you leave it with your original $100.

- Now, your total is $105, and your next earnings are calculated based on this larger amount.

- This keeps happening, and your money keeps growing faster and faster.

**If you save $10 a day, in 10 years, you will have $62,000, and in 20 years, you will have $90,000.**

**If you save $10 a day, and invest it with 10% return, in 10 years, you will have $36,000, and in 20 years, you will have $600,000.**

**If you save $20 a day, and invest it with 10% return, in 10 years, you will have $100,000, and in 20 years, you will have $2,000,000.**

Compound growth is like a money-making snowball that gets bigger as it rolls, thanks to the money it picks up along the way.

The concept of passive income has been trending. You can now make the money work by leveraging multiple investment vehicles, such as savings accounts and the stock market. 

Budgeting and investing apps and robo advisors such as HelloStocker app have been gaining in popularity and are here to help you with your personal finances. 

## 4. Conclusion

If you had saved and invested this money by age 11, just like Warren Buffett did, and knew about compound interest, how much money do you think you would have today? Would you be a millionnaire by now?
