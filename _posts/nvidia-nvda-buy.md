## Wish you bought Nvidia at $50 before it reaches $500?

&nbsp;  

&nbsp;  

This is what Nvidia looked like in 2018 when I bought it at $50 üìà

&nbsp;

&nbsp;  

And this is what happened to NVDA stock price right after üìâ


&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp; 

&nbsp;

The timing was not great, I had lost -35.6% on Nvidia.

&nbsp;


But this trade paid +1,100% over the longer run.

&nbsp;

I will reiterate on my initial thought process: the logic followed to take Nvidia investment decision.

&nbsp;

But apply this logic on today's market.

## Nvidia Analysis


&nbsp;

&nbsp;


### 1) Nvidia relies on AI and Tech Industry Trends

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

#### A) Digital technologies are now everywhere 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

There is an explosion of data being generated every day:

&nbsp;

\- 500 million tweets are sent

&nbsp;

\- 294 billion emails are sent

&nbsp;

\- 4 petabytes of data are created on Facebook

&nbsp;

\- 4 terabytes of data are created from each connected car

&nbsp;

\- 65 billion messages are sent on WhatsApp

&nbsp;

\- 5 billion searches are made

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

By 2025, it‚Äôs estimated that 463 exabytes of data will be created each day globally. No one ever heard the word exabytes before the invention of AI.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

AI thrives on data and the ability to analyze large datasets to derive meaningful insights. 

&nbsp;

This abundance of data provides a fertile ground for AI algorithms.

&nbsp;

They can train more accurately and improve their performance.

&nbsp;

Leading to enhanced decision-making and problem-solving.

&nbsp;


&nbsp;

#### B) AI automates human tasks

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

AI is freeing up human resources to focus on more critical and creative activities. 

&nbsp;

This increased automation can lead to improved operational efficiency.

&nbsp;

Automation and artificial intelligence will accelerate the shift in skills that the workforce needs.

&nbsp;

According to a study realised by McKinsey - by 2030 there will be a 50% increase in technology workers.


&nbsp;

If not more.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Total hours worked in Europe and United States, 2023 vs 2030 estimate in billion:

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

#### C) Artificial intelligence market size will skyrocket 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

AI enables businesses to better understand their customers.

&nbsp;

By analyzing their preferences, behavior, and historical data, AI allows for more targeted and personalized experiences.

&nbsp;

Better product recommendations, more tailored marketing campaigns. 


&nbsp;

AI is being adopted across various industries, such as healthcare, finance, retail, transportation, and agriculture.

&nbsp;

Netflix, Spotify, and HelloStocker, all leverage AI for better recommendations.

&nbsp;

Netflix for movies.

&nbsp;

Spotify for music.

&nbsp;

HelloStocker AI for stocks.

&nbsp;

They all use AI to drive innovation and deliver a times 10 better product to their customer. 

&nbsp;

The ability to deliver personalized and live experiences drives better recommendations.

&nbsp;

AI market size worldwide is predicted to rocket times 1,000.

&nbsp;

That's +100,000% over the next 10 years.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


#### D) Supportive Ecosystem

&nbsp;

Governments, research institutions, and tech companies are investing heavily in AI research and development. 

&nbsp;

This investment is fostering collaborations, attracting talent, and creating a supportive ecosystem for the growth of the AI industry. 

&nbsp;

Governments and companies who don't adopt AI will be left at the industrial age.

&nbsp;

According to a recent study by Goldman Sachs, more and more companies are adopting AI.

&nbsp;

It is taking a bigger market share across all sectors in our economy.


&nbsp;

16% of the top / biggest 3,000 companies in the US mentioned AI in their 2023 revenues reports.

&nbsp;

That's +100% more than in 2022!

&nbsp;


### 2) Nvidia Competitive landscape

&nbsp;

Before we dive into Nvidia's financial, it is worth mentioning that Nvidia is not alone.

&nbsp;

First tap the 'Competition button' on Nvidia


![](/assets/blog/nvidia/nvidia_competition_1.png)


#### A) Competitors sorted by Price to Earning 

&nbsp;

First we sort competitors by PE ratio (Price of the stock / Company earnings)

&nbsp;

This shows you which stocks are 'hyped' with high growth expectations.

&nbsp;

The lowest the PE, the more discounted is the stock: it is undervalued, but sometimes for a reason. 

&nbsp;

However: the highest the PE, the more overvalued is the stock: but again the market could expect something big.

&nbsp;

![](/assets/blog/nvidia/nvidia_competition_2.png)

&nbsp;

We see that some companies are even more 'hyped' than Nvidia! &nbsp;


&nbsp;


These are ARM and AMD:

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

\- ARM is overhyped because Softbank marketed it and it was all over the news. Never buy a stock right after Softbank does.

&nbsp;

\- ARM stock trading volume spiked because of its IPO: everyone bought the stock now over a short interval of time.

&nbsp;

\- Their IPO was everywhere in the news, and you could not buy the stock before, so everyone rushed on it and made the stock go up.

&nbsp;

\- It's a marketing strategy, just like when Apple shows their new iPhone model 2 months before the release date.

&nbsp;

\- Also, a portion of the money you invest on IPO goes to banks, when you buy the stock on IPO you don't give 100% to the company.

&nbsp;

\- That's funny isn't it? That's how banks get paid: they take 10% of the IPO price. ARM is definitely hyped.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Let's select AMD, it now shows in orange:

&nbsp;

![](/assets/blog/nvidia/nvidia_competition_3.png)

&nbsp;

We look at the changes in prices over the last 2 years: AMD price 2 years ago has been scaled to match Nvidia price.

&nbsp;

This way we can visually compare changes: returns and yields.

&nbsp;

Price itself is the ratio of Market Cap (company valuation) to Number of Shares Available to trade.

&nbsp;

\- 1) We see that Nvidia stock price outperformed AMD x 2.

&nbsp;

\- 2) Nvidia's Net Income also did x2, so it justified it's stock price change.

&nbsp;

\- 3) AMD Net Income decreased: which justifies why it's stock price did not increase.

&nbsp;

\- 4) Nvidia's earning per share doubled! Making a better deal than 2 years ago.

&nbsp;

Conclusion?

&nbsp;

There is no financial reason as of why AMD is more hyped than Nvidia.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

#### So why is AMD price so high compared to its earnings? üßê

&nbsp;

My guess is: most people don't understand what they are doing. üôÑ

&nbsp;

They put their money on a trading app and cross fingers.

&nbsp;

They see Nvidia price is high and spiked so they go for AMD.

&nbsp;

‚ùåAnd they think they will get a better deal with AMD. 

&nbsp;

‚úÖBut we look at the economics.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

#### B) Competitors sorted by Valuation


&nbsp;

Nvidia is first! The biggest whale out there.

&nbsp;

Guess who should we compare it with?

&nbsp;

Hint: (another big whale)

&nbsp;

![](/assets/blog/nvidia/nvidia_competition_4.png)

&nbsp;

TSM: Taiwan Semiconductor!

&nbsp;

![](/assets/blog/nvidia/nvidia_competition_5.png)


&nbsp;

\- 1) Taiwan Semiconductor's price didn't move, Nvidia did times 2


&nbsp;


\- 2) Is it justified? Seems like it is, Taiwan Semiconductor Earnings per Share didn't change, Nvidia did times 2.


&nbsp;


\- 3) What is the takeaway? I would rather by Taiwan Semiconductor shares than AMD.


&nbsp;


&nbsp;


### 3) Nvidia Financial performance

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### Short Term

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

There are only 2 ways someone knows what will happen in the short term.

&nbsp;

### 1) They know someone who works at Nvidia, or someone who can influence macro economic and political events

&nbsp;

Most likely you don't. It is unfair right? How do we make it fair? 

&nbsp;

The SEC thought of it, anyone who trades with insider information will be fined and jailed: it is a crime.

&nbsp;

You can predict what will happen within a couple of months or a couple of years.

&nbsp;

But you can't legally trade the stock and predict what will happen tomorrow.

&nbsp;

So can we make sure politicians and famous figures are not abusing their roles on the economy?

&nbsp;

Well: all their trades are disclosed.

&nbsp;

How interesting is it to know what politicians are doing? This could help with the short term.

&nbsp;

In HelloStocker we process public information and politicians trading activity and send you notifications on the stocks you bought in virtual trading!


&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### 2) They have access to news and information more efficiently than you do

&nbsp;

Well this is a helpful one!

&nbsp;

Why? Because there has been a new financial earnings report very recently!

&nbsp;

Let's take it into account to see what happened to the stock.


&nbsp;


How fast do you get access to information?

&nbsp;

Do you have a financial social platform AI powered app that sends you instant notifications as soon as anomalies in the main news broadcasting channels are detected and spotted as relevant?

&nbsp;

Install HelloStocker AI now.


&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### Long Term

&nbsp;

We discussed the AI industry prospects.

&nbsp;

Now let's see how the Earnings per Share value of Nvidia shares changed over time.

&nbsp;

Price to Earnings how much money does the company generated for $1 invested in the stock.

&nbsp;

[//]: # (And we saw how Nvidia stock price is actually even cheaper now than it has been before.)

&nbsp;

People see the price increase, so they think 'its expensive' but the actual company value is discounted.

&nbsp;


Buying the stock is now a bargain.

&nbsp;



### 4) Upcoming catalysts or events that could impact the stock price


&nbsp;

### 5) If I buy Nvidia, when should I realize my gains and sell?

&nbsp;

Ask your AI Financial Advisor: he will give you a price target at which you should sell.

&nbsp;

If you buy Nvidia stock in the virtual trading simulator, you will receive a reminder!


&nbsp;




### 5) Are you looking for +10% quick profit? or +10,000% profits?

&nbsp;

### 6) How much money are you not going to spend in the next 2 years and are you happy to lock in an investment?
