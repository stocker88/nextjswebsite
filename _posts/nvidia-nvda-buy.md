Wish you bought Nvidia at $50 before it reaches $500?

I bought Nvidia at $50 in summer 2019.

I have been tracking this stock daily for the past 4 years.

Reading every single news.

Telling you and everyone about what I believe would happen next.

And repeating myself until I decide to write it in an article I can share with you.

Today I stand with +1,000% returns on Nvda stocks.

Is Nvidia still a buy? 

Should I sell and realize profits? 

Or is it time to buy more Nvidia shares?
