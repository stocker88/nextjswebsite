&nbsp;

AI thrives on data and the ability to analyze large datasets to derive meaningful insights. 

&nbsp;

This abundance of data provides a fertile ground for AI algorithms.


&nbsp;

&nbsp;

#### D) Human workforce is shifting into AI and Tech

&nbsp;

[Source: McKinsey 2023 analysis ](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-work/skill-shift-automation-and-the-future-of-the-workforce)

&nbsp;

By 2030 there will be a 65% increase in technology workers.

&nbsp;

AI is freeing up human resources to focus on more critical and creative activities. 

&nbsp;

This increased automation can lead to improved operational efficiency.

&nbsp;

Automation and artificial intelligence will accelerate the shift in skills that the workforce needs.

&nbsp;

Prospects and innovations in the AI sector make it a buy. But what about Nvidia stock?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


### 1) Nvidia Financial performance

&nbsp;



### The Big Picture

&nbsp;

Nvidia is definitely not a bubble, it's change in revenues is supporting the change in share price.

&nbsp;

The company grows with **and facilitates the growth of** the industry it relies on: AI.

&nbsp;

![](/assets/blog/nvidia/nvidia_financials1.webp)

&nbsp;

Nvidia's change in Net Income is higher than the change in share price.

&nbsp;

The company did not release new shares (that could have diluted the share price).

&nbsp;

This is confirmed by the change in Earnings per Share (EPS is Total Earnings divided by Number of Shares available).

&nbsp;

The change in EPS confirms Nvidia has never been as discounted as it is now.

&nbsp;

## Wish you bought Nvidia at $50 before it reaches $500?

&nbsp;

This is what Nvidia looked like in 2018 when I bought it at $50 📈

&nbsp;

![](/assets/blog/nvidia/1.webp)

&nbsp;

And this is what happened to NVDA stock price right after 📉


&nbsp;

![](/assets/blog/nvidia/2.webp)

&nbsp;

The timing was not great, I had lost -35.6% on Nvidia.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


### The Short Term Picture

&nbsp;

There are only 3 ways to predict the short term.

&nbsp;

#### A) You know someone who works at Nvidia and can disclose revenues before they go public

&nbsp;

Anyone who trades and buys stocks based on insider information will be fined and jailed: it is a crime, don't mess with [the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/) (Security Exchange Commission).

&nbsp;

#### B) You know someone who can influence macro economics and political events

&nbsp;

Politicians and insider trades are disclosed on the [SEC's website](https://www.sec.gov/) we track what they buy / sell and notify you for stocks you follow in [StocksToBuyNow App](https://www.stockstobuynow.ai).

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

#### C) You have access to news and information more efficiently than others

&nbsp;

StocksToBuyNow tracks Hedge Fund activity ([form 10Q](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/895421/000119312511213320/d10q.htm)) and notify you in [StocksToBuyNow App](https://www.stockstobuynow.ai).

&nbsp;

We have social bots that monitors the web and alert you as soon as relevant news is detected.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### 3) Nvidia Competitive landscape

&nbsp;

Will Nvidia take the biggest share of the pot? What are other alternatives?

&nbsp;


### A) Competitors sorted by Price to Earning 

&nbsp;

First we sort competitors by PE ratio (Price of the stock / Company earnings)

&nbsp;

This shows you which stocks are 'hyped' with high growth expectations.

&nbsp;

![](/assets/blog/nvidia/nvidia_competition_2.webp)

&nbsp;

The lowest the PE, the more discounted is the stock.

&nbsp;

It means the stock is undervalued, but often for a reason. 

&nbsp;

However: the highest the PE, the more overvalued is the stock.

&nbsp;

Again here: the market could expect something big.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

#### Nvidia is a Better Option than ARM

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

We see that ARM and AMD are even more 'hyped' than Nvidia! &nbsp;

&nbsp;

\- ARM is overhyped: Softbank marketed it all over the news.

&nbsp;

→ Never buy a stock right after Softbank.

&nbsp;

\- ARM stock trading volume spiked because of its IPO.

&nbsp;

→ Everyone bought the stock over a short interval of time.

&nbsp;

\- Their IPO was pre released, you could not buy the stock before.

&nbsp;

→ Everyone rushed and made the stock spike for no reason.

&nbsp;

\- Apple pre releases new iPhone model before the official date.

&nbsp;

→ It is a marketing strategy / market manipulation tactic to create the IPO rush.

&nbsp;


\- When you buy the stock on IPO, the company doesn't receive 100% of investments.

&nbsp;

→ 15% of your money goes to the banks which setup the IPO

&nbsp;

 

&nbsp;


&nbsp;

Conclusion: ARM is overvalued, you better buy Nvidia.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

#### Nvidia is a Better Option than AMD

&nbsp;

Let's select AMD, it now shows in orange:

&nbsp;

![](/assets/blog/nvidia/nvidia_competition_3.webp)

&nbsp;

We look at the changes in prices over the last 2 years.

&nbsp;

AMD price 2 years ago has been scaled to match Nvidia price.

&nbsp;

\- 1) Nvidia stock price did x4, Nvidia's Net Income and EPS also did x4 → it validates the stock price change.

&nbsp;

\- 2) AMD Share Price Increased, but AMD Net Income decreased a lot and its EPS decreased 

&nbsp;

\- 3) This confirms AMD is overvalued, people are buying it because they think the 'share price is low', but price doesn't mean anything, company market value matters.

&nbsp;

\- 4) People also think Nvidia increased but AMD has not yet, so it should increase as well, but AMD financial performance has nothing to do with Nvidia.


&nbsp;

\- 5) You might make money with AMD, but not as much as you would with Nvidia, the price will rally back to match its financial performance and it will underperform.


&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Conclusion: you better buy Nvidia than buy AMD.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

#### So why is AMD price so high compared to its earnings? 🧐

&nbsp;

Most people don't understand what they are doing 🙄

&nbsp;

They see Nvidia price spiked so they buy AMD hoping it does the same.

&nbsp;

They think they will get a better deal with AMD ❌ 

&nbsp;

We just looked at competition financial analysis ✅

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### B) Competitors sorted by Valuation

&nbsp;

Nvidia is first! The biggest whale out there.

&nbsp;

Guess who you should compare it with?

&nbsp;

![](/assets/blog/nvidia/nvidia_competition_4.webp)


&nbsp;

If you had to pick a similar company, which one would be your next buy?

&nbsp;


Hint: (the second one)

&nbsp;

![](/assets/blog/nvidia/nvidia_competition_5.webp)


#### Nvidia is a Better Option than Taiwan SemiConductor

&nbsp;

\- 1) Taiwan Semiconductor's price didn't move

&nbsp;

\- 1) Nvidia stock price did times 2

&nbsp;

\- 3) Taiwan Semiconductor Earnings per Share didn't change

&nbsp;

\- 4) Nvidia EPS did times 2

&nbsp;

Both are aligned in terms of change pricing.

&nbsp;

Why is Taiwan Semiconductor Price to Earning so low?

&nbsp;

17 PE only, way below ARM, AMD and Nvidia...

&nbsp;

Taiwan could suffer from China interventions.

&nbsp;

Conclusion: buy Nvidia it is a better option here again.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


### 4) The Verdict

&nbsp;

The AI Industry is in the early stages of an exponential surge.

&nbsp;

Nvidia could become the next Apple anytime soon.

&nbsp;

Competition analysis showed why Nvidia remains the best buy and why competition is overhyped.

&nbsp;

It's not about prices.

&nbsp;

It's about Economics, Prospects and Value.


&nbsp;


&nbsp;


#### What are your goals?

&nbsp;

If you are looking for +10% quick profit => buy Altcoins. 

&nbsp;

Keep in mind when things moves fast, it goes in all directions: you must be open to take on losses.

&nbsp;

If you want to make long term +10,000% gains...

&nbsp;

If you have funds you are not planning on spending over the next couple of years...

&nbsp;

Buy Nvidia.
