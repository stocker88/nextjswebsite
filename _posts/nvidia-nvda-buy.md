&nbsp;

AI thrives on data and the ability to analyze large datasets to derive meaningful insights. 

&nbsp;

This abundance of data provides a fertile ground for AI algorithms.


&nbsp;

&nbsp;

#### D) Human workforce is shifting into AI and Tech

&nbsp;

McKinsey study on the total hours worked in Europe and United States: 2023 vs 2030 estimate in billion

[Source: McKinsey 2023 analysis ](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-work/skill-shift-automation-and-the-future-of-the-workforce)

&nbsp;

By 2030 there will be a 65% increase in technology workers.

&nbsp;

AI is freeing up human resources to focus on more critical and creative activities. 

&nbsp;

This increased automation can lead to improved operational efficiency.

&nbsp;

Automation and artificial intelligence will accelerate the shift in skills that the workforce needs.

&nbsp;

Prospects and innovations in the AI sector make it a buy. But what about Nvidia stock?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


### 1) Nvidia Financial performance

&nbsp;



### The Big Picture

&nbsp;

Nvidia is definitely not a bubble, it's change in revenues is supporting the change in share price.

$nbsp;

The company has managed to grow at the same pace if not faster than the industry it relies on: AI.

&nbsp;

![](/assets/blog/nvidia/nvidia_financials1.webp)

&nbsp;

Nvidia's change in Net Income is higher than the change in share price.

&nbsp;

There has been no substancial amount of new shares related from the company (that could have diluted the share price).

&nbsp;

This is confirmed by the change in Earnings per Share (Total Earnings divided by Number of Shares available).

&nbsp;

Looking at the change in Earning per Share, it seems like Nvidia has never been as discounted as it is now.

&nbsp;

## Wish you bought Nvidia at $50 before it reaches $500?

&nbsp;

This is what Nvidia looked like in 2018 when I bought it at $50 📈

&nbsp;

![](/assets/blog/nvidia/1.webp)

&nbsp;

And this is what happened to NVDA stock price right after 📉


&nbsp;

![](/assets/blog/nvidia/2.webp)

&nbsp;

The timing was not great, I had lost -35.6% on Nvidia.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


### The Short Term Picture

&nbsp;

There are only 3 ways for you to know what will happen in the short term.

&nbsp;

#### A) You know someone who works at Nvidia who can disclose you revenues before they become public

&nbsp;

Anyone who trades and buys stocks based on insider information will be fined and jailed: it is a crime, don't mess with [the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/) (Security Exchange Commission).

&nbsp;

#### B) You know someone who can influence macro economic and political events

Politicians and insider trades are disclosed on the [SEC's website](https://www.sec.gov/) we track what they buy / sell and notify you for stocks you follow in [HelloStocker App](https://www.hellostocker.com).

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

#### C) You have access to news and information more efficiently than others

&nbsp;

HelloStocker tracks Hedge Fund activity ([form 10Q](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/895421/000119312511213320/d10q.htm)) and notify you in [HelloStocker App](https://www.hellostocker.com).

&nbsp;

We have social bots that crawl the web and alert you as soon as relevant news is published.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### 3) Nvidia Competitive landscape

&nbsp;

Will Nvidia take the biggest share of the pot? What are other alternatives?

&nbsp;


#### A) Competitors sorted by Price to Earning 

&nbsp;

First we sort competitors by PE ratio (Price of the stock / Company earnings)

&nbsp;

This shows you which stocks are 'hyped' with high growth expectations.

&nbsp;

![](/assets/blog/nvidia/nvidia_competition_2.webp)

&nbsp;

The lowest the PE, the more discounted is the stock: it is undervalued, but sometimes for a reason. 

However: the highest the PE, the more overvalued is the stock: but again the market could expect something big.

&nbsp;

We see that ARM and AMD are even more 'hyped' than Nvidia! &nbsp;

&nbsp;

\- ARM is overhyped because Softbank marketed it and it was all over the news. Never buy a stock right after Softbank does.


\- ARM stock trading volume spiked because of its IPO: everyone bought the stock now over a short interval of time.


\- Their IPO was everywhere in the news, and you could not buy the stock before, so everyone rushed on it and made the stock go up.


\- It's a marketing strategy, just like when Apple shows their new iPhone model 2 months before the release date.


\- Also, a portion of the money you invest on IPO goes to banks, when you buy the stock on IPO you don't give 100% to the company.


\- That's funny isn't it? That's how banks get paid: they take 10% of the IPO price. 


&nbsp;

Conclusion: ARM is overvalued.

&nbsp;

Let's select AMD, it now shows in orange:

&nbsp;

![](/assets/blog/nvidia/nvidia_competition_3.webp)

&nbsp;

We look at the changes in prices over the last 2 years: AMD price 2 years ago has been scaled to match Nvidia price.

&nbsp;

\- 1) We see that Nvidia stock price outperformed AMD x 2.

\- 2) Nvidia's Net Income also did x2, so it justified it's stock price change.

\- 3) AMD Net Income decreased a lot: it's share price should have decreased more.

\- 4) Earning per share confirms that AMD is overvalued: Share Price is the ratio of Market Cap (Valuation) to Number of Shares Available to trade.


&nbsp;

Conclusion: AMD is overvalued compared to Nvidia.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

#### So why is AMD price so high compared to its earnings? 🧐

&nbsp;

My guess is: most people don't understand what they are doing. 🙄
They see Nvidia price spiked so they buy AMD instead since it didn't spike.

&nbsp;

❌And they think they will get a better deal with AMD. 

&nbsp;

✅But we just looked at the competition economics historical analysis.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

#### B) Competitors sorted by Valuation

&nbsp;

Nvidia is first! The biggest whale out there.

Guess who you should compare it with?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

If you had to pick a similar company, which one would be your next buy?

&nbsp;


Hint: (the second one)

&nbsp;

![](/assets/blog/nvidia/nvidia_competition_5.webp)


&nbsp;

\- 1) Taiwan Semiconductor's price didn't move, Nvidia did times 2

\- 2) Is it justified? Seems like it is, Taiwan Semiconductor Earnings per Share didn't change, Nvidia did times 2

\- 3) What is the takeaway? If you want to diversify, you better buy 50% Nvidia and 50% Taiwan Semiconductor stocks than buy AMD


&nbsp;


&nbsp;



### 4) Your Goals

&nbsp;

The AI Industry is in the early stages of an exponential surge.

&nbsp;

With this in mind, Nvidia could become the next Apple anytime soon.


&nbsp;

Competition analysis showed why Nvidia remains the best buy and why competition is overhyped.


&nbsp;

It's not about prices. It's about Economics: it's about Value.


&nbsp;


&nbsp;


#### Are you looking for +10% quick profit? or +10,000% profits?

&nbsp;

If you are looking for +10% quick profit => buy Altcoins. 

&nbsp;

Keep in mind when things moves fast, it goes in all directions: you must be open to take on losses.

&nbsp;

If you want to make long term gains, and have funds/investments you are not planning on spending over the next couple of years: Nvidia is your buy.
