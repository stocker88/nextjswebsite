## Analysis

&nbsp;

### 1. Trump First Presidency

&nbsp;

In his first term, Donald Trump earned a surprising reputation among hedge funds: 

&nbsp;

not just as a political figure, but as a catalyst for volatility. 

&nbsp;

His unpredictable tweets and policy pivots created waves across global markets, sending the VIX (the “fear index”) into motion and making it a playground for active traders.

&nbsp;

Historically, Trump has been Wall Street’s best friend when it comes to volatility. 

&nbsp;

Under his administration, hedge funds profited from short-term swings that many retail traders were unprepared for. 

&nbsp;

And we saw the pattern. 

&nbsp;

And when Trump returned to the headlines in early 2025, we knew what was coming next.


&nbsp;

More volatility.

&nbsp;

### 2. Why We Bought VIX and How We Gained x11

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

As Trump started his second presidency, markets started dipping on on tariff threats, political pressure on the Fed increased: volatility was bound to rise once again. 

&nbsp;

We positioned accordingly:

&nbsp;

•	Trump was expected to send volatility to new heights once again.

&nbsp;

•	In a tech-heavy portfolio, VIX offers crucial downside protection.

&nbsp;

•	Buying VIX calls is like shorting the market — when stocks fall, volatility spikes.

&nbsp;

•	It’s also a tool for timing market bottoms, as volatility tends to peak at inflection points.

&nbsp;

•	When VIX reached $55 this was a strong signal to take profits and pivot into a safe even alternative with downside protection.

&nbsp;

Our AI Signal flagged the breakout, and we acted fast.

### 3. Why We Pivoted into RGLD

&nbsp;

Royal Gold (RGLD) is a royalty play on gold — but more than that, it’s a conservative hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty:


&nbsp;

•	Gold historically rallies during inflation spikes and financial system stresses.

&nbsp;

•	RGLD isn’t just a gold proxy — it’s a lean, cash-generative business with strong margins and minimal debt.

&nbsp;

•	It adds value exposure to balance the volatility of growth tech names.

&nbsp;

•   AI saw strong fundamentals, a rising gold trend, VIX being now too high to hold longer: perfect timing for a value pivot.

## The Trump Volatility Trade Isn’t Over

&nbsp;

Trump’s return to the stage brings more than headlines — it brings waves of volatility (VIX ups and downs).


&nbsp;

Expect volatility. Plan for dislocation. And know that:

&nbsp;

•	Volatility can be timed — it’s measurable and seasonal.

&nbsp;

•	Volatility can be profitable — especially when paired with value plays like RGLD / Gold proxies.

&nbsp;

Whether you’re hedging your tech exposure or playing the next wave, this was the Trump trade that worked — and it’s still in play.
